# Budgie and Cinnamon Builds now available

Happy Friday, we have two new sets of images for you today:

<div class="grid" markdown>

[Budgie](https://github.com/ublue-os/budgie) - a familiar, modern desktop environment
{ .card }

[Cinnamon](https://github.com/ublue-os/cinnamon) - featuring a traditional layout, built from modern technology and introducing brand new innovative features
{ .card }

</div>

Please note that these images are relatively new, they haven't seen much testing and are mostly vanilla. We intend to replace the Budgie image with [Fedora Onyx](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Fedora_Onyx), which will be the final name for the Fedora image-based Budgie desktop. Currently we are expecting that to happen in Fedora 39 so we are offering this image as a placeholder for you to kick the tyres and leave feedback. 

The Cinnamon image is unofficial, if you are interested in helping to make it higher quality we're looking for more volunteers. We're hoping to find people who know enough about Fedora and Cinnamon to help set up that image upstream, inquire within if you're interested in that.
